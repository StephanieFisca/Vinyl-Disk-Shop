This is a university project for refining my Php programming skills.
The project is a vinyl disk shop, where you can add, modify, view, delete different vinyl discs from the database.
The project also contains an administration section that requires a login, and offers the posibility of altering values in different tables, viewing comments 
left by different users about each classical piece, etc.
The database was created in PhpMyAdmin, being a MariaDB database.
